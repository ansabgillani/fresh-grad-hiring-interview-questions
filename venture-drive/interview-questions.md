# Questions
These questions were asked during VentureDrive interviews.

##	General:
1.	Describe yourself
2.	Describe your FYP
3.	Why VentureDive?
4.	How much did you prepare for this interview?
5.	What do you prefer? C++, Java, Android?

##	Programming:
1.	Swap two integers without having a temporary variable ?
2.	Find duplicates in an array without using HashMaps in O(N) ?
3.	Different version of a function overriding, with either different return type or with different parameters. Does this qualify as function overriding as well ?
4.	Difference between overriding a simple function and overriding a virtual function?
5.	What will happen if I try to change Java bytecode through a Java program?
6.	Difference between overloading and overriding
7.	Draw a UML diagram of a project ( they gave me one of my university projects)
8.	How to find if a linked-list has a cycle?
9.	Write pseudocode to implement a stack.
10.	Suppose a C++ class has a virtual function, can we create its object?
11.	What are friend functions or classes? If class C is inheriting from class B and class A is a friend of class B, can class C also access class A?
12.	What happens if data is increased in case of recursion? (Ans: space complexity issue i.e. stack overflow)
13.	How the compiler gets to know which function to execute in case of overriding? (Hint: Vtable)
14.	Why can't we instantiate objects of abstract classes? (Ans: no entry of virtual functions in Vtable)
15.	Wrote 3 structs and asked about the size of each in memory. (Hint: space less than 1 word size cannot be allocated in memory)
16.	Given a string of n length. Write code to generate all permutations of that string
17.	Write recursive code to traverse bst in order.
18.	How are AVL rotations performed?

##	Android / Java:
1.	Write the code for an activity.
2.	What are memory leaks in Android?
3.	How can we avoid memory leak?
4.	How many threads are there in Android?
5.	Why use Fragments instead of Activities?
6.	What if a fragment gets destroyed?
7.	How are threads created?
8.	Is it guaranteed that a thread will start considering I write the code and run it? Suppose I have 10K threads and I start another. Is it guaranteed to start?
9.	I have two threads arriving at the same time, how do I select one that should always run first?
10.	Why do we use threads?
11.	What can go wrong if I have a network call in a thread that updates the UI after receiving the data? What can I do to solve this?
12.	What is Hibernate?

##	OOAD:
1.	Implement polymorphism without having interhitence?
2.	Diff b/w Polymorphism and Inheritance?
3.	Diff b/w Data Encapsulation and Data Abstraction?
4.	How can we do Data Encapsulation?
5.	How can we do Data Abstraction?
6.	Does it is necessary that a class having Abstraction will have encapsulation ?
7.	What is Factory pattern?
8.	What is State pattern?
9.	What is coupling and cohesion?
10.	Which is better, coupling or cohesion? Why?
11.	Why do we use Design Patterns? What are the benefits?

##	Database:
1.	What is Indexing? If the table has only primary keys does it need to store index or cluster index ?
2.	Draw the schema for an Airline Management System (Selected from the course projects)
3.	Using the drawn schema. Write a query to view the information of passengers that have bought the ticket for a flight that is going from JFK to ISB but has been cancelled and the passenger has not boarded yet. Also the airplane should be Airbus.
4.	Write a query to get the student with second highest marks in a table.
5.	What are transactions?
 
##	Analytical:
1.	You have two ropes. They burn in 30 minutes each. I want to know when 45 minutes pass.
2.	You have 8 balls. 7 of them are 8g each. One ball is 10g. You have a manual balance (scale). How would you efficiently find the heavier ball?
3.	There is an elephant that needs to go 1000 km across, it can only carry 1000 items at one time. You have total 3000 Items how much will you be able to transport if elephant consumes 1 item on 1 km.

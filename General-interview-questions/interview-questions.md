# Questions
These are general purpose questions that are asked in almost every interview. Most of the questions are subjected to understand your attitude, confidence and professionalism. Below them are the ways to answer them.

## 1. Tell us about yourself
Well, I am Ansab and I graduated from PUCIT last year as a Computer Scientist. I recently joined Arbisoft as a Software Engineer, right after my graduation. Before that, I had 2 years of business development and engineering experience in various freelancing and startup ventures. I did my FYP in DHT-based blockchain systems which focused on improving space complexity for blockchains. It involved various domains of knowledge such as blockchain protocols, DHT protocols, web servers, networking and front-end development.

## 2. Why we should hire you?
I am hardworking and passionate about engineering. Even though I have a limited knowledge domain, I always try to find unique and long lasting problem-solving solution.I always aspire to perfect the perfections and produce a new insight on relevant problems. That reflects on my contributions in the open-source community. (Expect follow up questions on this. They will ask you examples on how you came to this conclusion about yourself.) During my internship, we had many engineering problems to be addressed and we didn't have senior resources to help us archittect. So, me and my peers stepped up to take on these problems and brute-forced our way to the solution, even though it had many gaps for improvements.

## 3. Why this company?
(This is the money-shot here. This is where you ensure you'll provide your worth to a company. Do research about them.) I've been in various engineering roles and have filled many hats as an employee. I saw on your website that you have built X product. I think it's an incredible idea and I think if I got the opportunity to work in this particular product, I could add value in it's Y domain. (Give an example). 
(The point of answering these questions does not necessarily mean you'll get the chance to work in that domain, it reflects your ideation and passion for a particular product.)

## 4. Tell us about your projects?
(Primarily, add your FYP project heree, whether it's complete or not.) Like I said, we developed DHT-based blockchain systems as our FYP. The primary target was to introduce a DNS lookup system that operates on P2P communications. (Give the background on what was already done and what was the unique thing you added in your project. And how it turned out to be.)

(In case you are asked about semester project, answer in following way) I have developed a job portal as a semester project during web engineering. We were given a list of poteential problems to be addressed before our final submissions and all of were required to solve that problem in a 6 week time. I chose the topic on Talent scouting and developed a job portal that allows employers to reach out to university students for internships through problem solving. I used templates from bootstrap themes for frontend and problem generation technique from advent of code and offered students to solve the coding problems on their own before applying to a particular job on my portal.

## 5. Tell us about your FYP?
Same answer as above

## 6. Why did you choose that technology?
(The key to this question is the research and comparison to other languages/framework. Don't ever use the phrases like "I was comfortable in this".) So, I chose to do my projects in Flask and React. I always loved solving problems in Python and I think I can very easily engineer solution to certain problems in this language. Moreover, there are so many libraries and pre-built frameworks that help you solve complex problems in just a few lines, which in return allowed me to solve the more problems in less time.

## 7. Define your role in your FYP?
Overall, it was a collective approach for our FYP since it required us to bounce ideas off each other, so we all had to be there. We collectively took the responsibility on leaderships time to time as well. As for our development phase, I ook on the responsibility of development of our networking servers which connected with an interface as well as other servers inside our P2P system.

## 8. What are your Salary Expectations
(This depends on what you want to say. Most of the recruiters already know what a software house is offering and you may  mention if you have an offer from a particular software house without mentioning the value. I, personally, took another route and put the ball in their court and  negotiate on what they had to offer. However, its important that you know the ballpark most software houses are offering so you don't undersell yourself.) I am in dawn of my career and right now I want to focus on establishing my knowledge and expertise in the field without, of course, comprising much monetarily. I have offers from X and Y software houses and I am keeping my options open. I want to know what you can offer and I will see where I can geet more value for my career.

## 9. What is your interest in Software Engineering: Frontend or Backend?
(This depends on your taste. I personally like solving engineering problems and work on UI/UX side-by-side, so I naurally have an inclination for frontend.)

## 10. Your biggest achievement
(Try to be humble about. Don't over or undersell yourself.) My biggest achievement is the realization that I can deliver when I am required to. I have, despite my habit of procastination, been asked for help in domains I don't have any expertise in. It felt great when I delivered.

## 11. Your strengths
I can vision an idea and build a business use case out of it with a plan to execute it. I can take leadership for projects and deliver it to their end. Even though many of my ideas sound ridiculous at first, but with the right execution, they always turn out to be ground breaking.

## 12. Your weaknesses
(Be honest about it. State the thing that sounds good on paper but is not) I would say I am a perfectionist. I take my job, not as a profession but as an art. For example, I don't like to push a code in production if I know it has bugs. As a result, sometimes I overpromise and underdeliver.

## 13. Your future plans
(This is trick question. You are expected to align with company's ideals and are expected not to turn out a job hopper. My advice: Be diplomatic here.)

## 14. Your ideal organization / tech firm
(Be honest, again. I personally defined an organization that is both fun and competitive.)

## 15. Tell us your CGPA in your degree? Why did you score less? (Just in case)
My CGPA was X.XX, which is low by my standards. I personally didn't like sitting in the class and taking lectures. Not to disrespect, I personally think that a 1:30 lecture can be delivered in 15 minutes and the students should be engaged in elsewise activities to grab knowledge of that subject or topic. Naturally, I missed most of the sessionals and engaged myself in other activites and compensated in other curricular and co-curricular activities as visible on my resume.

## 16. Tell us about your hobbies?
I like to listen to podcast and play static games. Most of the time, I put on puzzling games, such as Assassin's Creed that does not require much of my focus and listen to podcasts. (I was once asked which podcast I listen to. My reply was "I listen to podcast on applications or products that I want to build. I personally have this problem that I can't bounce off my ideas with a lot of people. This hobby helps me compensate on this problem.")

## 17. What do you do when you're free?
Same answer as above.

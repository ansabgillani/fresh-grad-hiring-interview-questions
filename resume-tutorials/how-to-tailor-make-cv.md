# How to Tailor make a CV
For many job seekers, it's not uncommon to find 20 or so positions you'd like to apply for when conducting an online job search.

It may sound like a time consuming process, but making the effort to tailor your CV to suit the requirements of each particular job that you are applying for can greatly increase your chances of securing an interview. The following are the main areas of your CV that should be adapted to meet the exact requirements.

### Personal Statement
You have read the requirements of the advertised position and understand what qualities the recruiter is looking for in a candidate. Sum up your unique selling points and, in a brief sentence, state your accomplishments and how these will help you succeed in the job you are applying for.

### Employment History
If you are applying for a managerial position but have never previously worked as manager, emphasise that your previous roles involved considerable responsibility and decision-making duties such as delegation, chairing meetings, training staff, etc.

If a separate role is more of a sideways step, you may want to focus more on innovative ways you have achieved success in the role to show your competency. Make it clear that whatever it is they want, you're able to fulfil their needs.

### Skills
Presumably most of the roles you're after will have a similar set of skills, but that doesn't mean you should leave this section alone. Think how easy it would be for a recruiter to see that you're suitable if the skills you demonstrate are in the same order that have on their job description.

### Hobbies and Interests
Most job advertisements stipulate certain personality traits required for positions, so identify what they are and see how your hobbies can relate to the requirements.

If you are applying for a senior position, then the fact that you captained your football team and ran training sessions will demonstrate your leadership and organisational ability. If you are seeking a position as a designer, then make reference to the exhibitions that you attend or are actively involved in and the designers that you admire.

If you want to position yourself as one of the strongest candidates for the job, it is worth doing your homework on the company that you are applying to. Their job advert will provide you with a glimpse of what the company is like, but you can find valuable information on their corporate website that will help you to understand what they may be looking for in a job applicant. Try and make the way your CV comes across match their company ethos.

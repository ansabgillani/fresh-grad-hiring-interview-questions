# How to write a CV

Recruitment software now scans your CV for key words and skills used in the job advertisement. This software is used by recruitment agents and many employers. This means that you should change your CV for each job application, using key words from the job advertisement.

## Two types of CV
There are two main types of CV:
- Skills-focused CV – useful for career changers, school leavers or people with gaps in work history.
- Work-focused CV – useful for showcasing work experience and for people progressing to the next stage in their career.

## Make your CV easy to read
Recruiters take 15-20 seconds to scan your CV the first time. If you make a good impression, they'll read your CV more closely. 
To make your CV look good:
- use a black, easy-to-read font in one size
- use short sentences and break up blocks of text
- use bullet points to list information
- keep the tone formal
- avoid abbreviations, slang or jargon
- avoid photos or images
- have strong headings and lots of white space
- keep your CV to one page.
- Save your CV as a PDF. PDF are viewable in browsers everywhere.
- Label your CV files with the format: {FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf} and your email Subject line: {Your name and the job you're applying for}

## What to put in your CV
A CV must include:
- your name and contact details
- technical and personal skills
- work, and community and volunteer experience
- qualifications and education
- referrals (you can include referees or note that referees are available on request).

A CV could also include:
- an objective and personal statement
- achievements
- interests
- job-specific information (for example, a teacher would put their teaching philosophy in their CV).

## What not to put in your CV
Don't put:
- a photo or images
- coloured or fancy fonts or design
- your date of birth or age
- your marital status, religion or bank account details
- too much text and bad spelling
- a funny or rude email address
- work experience or interests that are not relevant to the job
- lies about your experience and skills.

## Name and contact details
Include:
- first and last name (this should be in large and bold text)
- Your city
- phone number 
- email address.

Optional:
- job hunting profile link, such as LinkedIn or Behance
- your professional website or Youtube channel link.

Make sure that:
- your email address is work-appropriate, for example, syedansab500@gmail.com

## Objective and personal statement
An objective gives brief details about the type of work and role you would like and the industry you want to work in. A personal statement gives the employer an idea of who you are in three or four sentences. 

You can include:
- what you're currently doing for employment or education
- what attracted you to the job you're applying for
- your reason you're applying for this job
- your career goals.

## Skills
The skills you put in your CV should be the same skills listed in the job advertisement.

### Technical skills
Include a technical skill section in your CV to list skills such as:
- Frameworks
- Programming languages
- Other skills like UI/UX and/or leadership.

### Examples of writing about personal skills in your CV 
In a skills-focused CV, list the skills from the job advertisement with examples of how you've used those skills. This should be at the top of your CV.
- Strong communication skills
- - President of X Society
- - Managed an event catering 2000 students.

- In a work-focused CV, describe your skills separately.

## Work history and work or volunteer experience
List your most recent jobs or work and volunteer experience first. Your work history needs to include:
- the name of the employer
- the job title/role
- where the job was located
- start date and end date.
- Beneath this, list the tasks you performed. Also list any achievements.
- If you change jobs in the same organisation, include both job titles/roles. You don't need to list all your work history – keep your CV short.

Note: Only add work history that you can endorse. After hiring, many companies require you to provide job leaving certificates from your past employers.

## Format of qualifications section
List the newest or most relevant qualification first. Include:
- name of the course or qualification you completed
- name of the course provider
- where you studied
- start and finish date of your training or study, or the year you graduated.

## Achievements
Include an achievements section in your CV if you have important achievements that aren't covered in the skills or work history sections. You can include such things as:
- awards and commendations
- successfully completed projects
- examples of how you helped a former employer meet their targets
- important contributions to the community.
- For each example, note what the achievement was, and when and where you achieved it.

## Interests
Including your interests on your CV is optional. If you do, make sure you:
- include interests that show skills that employers are looking for such as leadership skills
- avoid common interests such as watching TV or going out with friends.

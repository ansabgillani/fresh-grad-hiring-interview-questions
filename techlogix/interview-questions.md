# Questions
These questions were asked during Techlogix interviews.

##	Algorithmic analysis and basic programming logic
1.	Write a function that takes a char string like “1234” or “-1234” and returns int
2.	Given are three numbers x, y and z such that x = yz. Write a function to compute x. Find its time complexity. Can you optimize it?
3.	Given a singly linked list, print values from nth to last element of the list.
4.	Swap 2 integers a and b without using another variable
5.	Given 2 arrays A and B, give all the pairs in A and B (e.g. A[i], B[j]) that give a sum of k. (Note: there is a solution with O(nlogn) and also with O(n) by using hashing)
6.	Given a function that generates a random number between 20-50, write a function that generates a random number between 10-70. (scale approach)
7.	Write a program to print the maximum numbers from an array of size n in windows of size x sliding across. For example, if [1 6 5 1 3 7 8] and x = 3, then output [6 6 5 7 8].
8.	Write a function to check if a string is palindrome or not.


##	OOAD:
1.	What is the difference between using Interfaces and inheriting Classes (in Java)
2.	Why use OOAD opposed to sequential and functional.
3.	List and describe some OOP design patterns.


##	SQL
1.	Write a query to find list the employee name, manager name and dept name (from very generic tables)
2.	What is Normalization and why do we use it (follow up:Why remove redundancy?)
3.	What are aggregate functions

##	Analytical:
1.	An airplane flies from Islamabad to Karachi in 90 mins but flies back from Karachi to Islamabad in 1 hour 30 minutes. Why?
2.	There's a room with dimensions X * Y. You're given tiles of N*N. Maximize N such that the tiles completely cover the room.
3. 	The longest distance you can travel when you have 3 motor bike tires that wear out after 30 km ?

##	Generic
1.	Explain what is your FYP
2.	Tell me about yourself


##	Technical (Database, Implementation, Business analyst )
1.	What are the advantages of normal forms to customer and to engineer
2.	Which one is faster, normalized or single table for data extraction
3.	What is the difference between truncate drop and delete
4.	Why is there need for views alongside table?

##	Second in-office Interview:
1.	What are you doing these days?
2.	Talk about the projects you mentioned (for the above question)
3.	Talk about your FYP. What are its applications? How do you judge its importance?
4.	Which programming language do you prefer? Why?
5.	Can foreign keys be null?
6.	What is an index? Why do we use it?
7.	How to deal with views if there is a change in original tables?
8.	What is performance wise better join or a subquery?
9.	In which case accessing data will be fast, a sorted array or a hashmap?
10.	Without using any built-in functions, how would you tell if a number is a power of 2?
11.	When do you use recursion over iteration?
12.	Without using any built-in functions, how would you calculate square root of a number?
13.	Do you watch any movies? If so, which kind?
14.	What are your strengths? What are your weaknesses?
15.	Name any design patterns. How have you used the ones you named in your projects?
16.	Did you do any internship in the summers?

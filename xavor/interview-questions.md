##	Technical:

2.	FYP
3.	Other than FYP, which project gave you the most satisfaction?
4.	Any other projects
5.	How do you deal with a problem that you just can’t solve
6.	How would you deal with a teammate who isn’t completing their work on time?

##	Analytical / Programming:
1.	A building has 100 floors. You have 2 similar mobiles. How would you find the maximum floor from which dropping the phone would not break it? (Optimize time and you can waste both phones)
2.	You have two ropes. They each take one hour to burn. How would you know when 45 minutes have passed? They don’t burn sequentially, i.e., you can’t keep track of how much of the rope has burnt (10%, 25%,...)
3.	Write a program to find the first non-repeating letter in a string. For example, “abbcdaa” then “c” is he first non-repeating letter. Can you go better than O(n2)? You cannot use additional data structures (including an array, which until the interviewer pointed out, I had totally forgotten is also a data structure). The only string functions you can use are indexing (s[i]) and s.length( )
4.	You have a balance and eight balls which are of same size and have exactly same appearance. 1 out of eight balls has more weight than rest of the seven individual balls. You have to find the ball which weighs more by using balance as minimum times as possible.

##	SQL / DB:
1.	A query is taking a very long time to execute, how will you debug and what might be the problems.

3.	What are Stored Procedures?
4.	What are User Defined Functions?

##	Java:

5.	Given a directory tree, code a function get all the files in that File System. What will the code be if BFS is used? What if DFS is used?
6.	What is a static class?
7.	Is it necessary for a static class to have static data members and static functions?
8.	What if I write a public static abstract class?
9.	If children do not overwrite the functions of the parent class (abstract), do functions occupy the same memory locations for multiple children?

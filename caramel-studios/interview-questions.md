# Questions
These questions were asked during Caramel Studios interviews.

## Java
1.	Why does the prototype of a copy constructor contain an &?
2.	Can you pass by value in Java?
3.	Can you pass a primitive data type by reference in Java?

## Mathematical
1.	A bin has 12 red balls, 10 blue balls, and 8 green balls.
2.	How many balls do you need to pick so you're certain you have two of each color?
3.	How many balls do you need to pick so you're certain you have two of any color?

## Generic Programming
1.	Given a number, write a function to reverse it (so 12345 -> 54321)
2.	Write a generic method to map 2d array indices to a linear memory offset. For example, given an array of dimensions 2x3 and index [1,1], return 4.
3.	Write recursive function for power of a variable x^y
4.	Can you call static variables from a non-static member function? What about the other way around?
5.	Let’s say there’s a formula to get elements of a 1d array i.e. arr(i) = x + 2i . It means if you enter arr(1), it will return x + 2*1 = x+2 and give you `arr[1]` of an array. Now create a formula for doing this for 2D array.
6.	Delete nth last node from linked list 
7.	Remove the middle node of singly linked list, you only have access to middle node, can’t access or use root node or end node.
8.	Find all combinations in array whose sum equals given number.
9.	Find Rotating substring in other String 
10.	Place zeroes to last indexes in array. 
11.	Find distance between 2 nodes of BST.
12.	Permutation variables in array
13.	write query to find out 3rd max salary
14.	Write function to tell if string is Anagram string or not. 
15.	Given an integer array for example 17,5,8,30,5,25,18 and a number n. Find all those combinations of numbers from the array whose sum is equal to n? 
16.	Find the intersection of two singly linked lists in O(n)
17.	find palindrome in singly linked list  
18.	Find all possible combinations of an array 
19.	Find if linked lists intersects or not.
20. Bst insertion, Bst inorder traversal
21.	Reverse the singly link list
22.	Mirror the Binary tree.
23.	Tell if a number is even or odd without using any condition.
24.	Given two sorted arrays, make another array and place all the elements of array 1 and 2 in sorted format. 
25.	MVC architecture.
26.	Mirror the Binary tree.
27.	Detect, remove loop in graph
28.	Find max contiguous sum in array.
29.	Fibonacci, palindrome, reverse an array

## SQA
1.	What is smoke testing? Identify initial two smoke cases of a lift?
2.	What are usecases and testcases? Give one example of a usecase and identify its testcases.
3.	What are components of a test case?
4.	What are bugs? What are errors?
5.	Some bug scenarios were given to identify the bug severity and priority as high, medium or low.

## Analytical Questions
1.	You are present in a basement that has three electric buttons for three bulbs present on ground floor.For all three electric buttons you have to identify which electric button is associated to which bulb by only going to the ground floor once. (Hint: Concept of Energy/Heat)
